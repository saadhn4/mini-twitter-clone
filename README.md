# 🐦 TweetClone

A simple Twitter-style mini posting app built using **React**. Users can write and post short messages (tweets), which appear below the input box styled as tweet cards. Responsive design ensures usability on mobile as well.

## 🚀 Features

- Create and post tweets instantly
- Clean and minimal UI
- Responsive layout for mobile screens
- Smooth button hover effect
- Profile picture included for each tweet (same image used for simplicity)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **CSS** for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for DOM interactions

## 💡 How it Works

1. User types a tweet in the input box.
2. Clicks the "Tweet" button to post.
3. Tweet is added to the `posts` state array.
4. Posts are rendered dynamically in tweet-style cards.

## 📝 Notes

- The profile picture is static (`goat.jpeg`) and used for all tweets.
- Basic input validation prevents empty tweets.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- On smaller screens:
- The input and tweets stack vertically
- Font sizes and profile image sizes are adjusted for mobile view
